        <h2>Investor's Rejects (S1)</h2>
        <h5>(2022-2024)</h5>
        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>Investor's Rejects was the first MiniTWOW I've hosted. It got 16 contestants and ran for 7 rounds. Themed around business and corporation and stuff, it had some images leading up to the prompt. Due to some... issues with being underage at the time, the finale was suspended until 2024, when I returned to the TWOW community, doing finale results shortly after. In S1, BestKP won, with PoppinKenny taking second.</p>

        <h2>SandboxTWOW (S0-1)</h2>
        <h5>(2024, 2024)</h5>
        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>SandboxTWOW was hosted after my return to the TWOW community. It's meant to experiment with twists, and mechanics. It's also the first miniTWOW of mine to not go on hiatus!</p>
        <p>Season 0 was mostly vanilla, though there was a technical in one round. ringedplanet (aka voii) won this season, with Algotistic in second.</p>
        <p>Season 1 is in signups, and features items as its twist.</p>
